# Optimized Traffic Light with Computer Vision
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Work_in_Progress-blue)
Designing an Optimized Traffic Light Control System using a hybrid of Image Classification and Object Detection
## Overview


This is the codebase of a college academic capstone research *(on going)*. It uses YOLO and EfficientNet to train the models to be used for inferencing

## Requirements

To install the dependencies with pipenv:
*Assuming you have pipenv already installed*

```bash
pipenv install
```

## Instructions
1. Use desired microprocessor. This project uses Beaglebone Black and Arduino. Install the desired packages to control GPIO pins. For Arduino, StandardPyFirmata was installed.
2. 
3.
